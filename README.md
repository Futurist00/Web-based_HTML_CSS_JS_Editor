# Web-based_HTML_CSS_JS_Editor
This project was written by myself completely from scratch. It is meant to be a JSFiddle clone.

Download the repository and open "index.html" on your favorite browser.

There will be three windows(editors) each for HTML, CSS, and Javascript respectively. 
Once you write code in each of these languages, you can click run and see the output in the right window.
